/**
 * Remembers a launcher that opens the platform's image picker and hands back a [PickedImage].
 *
 * The image stays in whatever form its platform produced it — see [PickedImage] — so nothing is
 * copied or decoded until `decodeToLumaMap` asks for it. The button itself stays in `GenScanScreen`
 * so its styling lives in one place rather than once per platform.
 *
 * A dismissed picker is silent: it reports neither a pick nor an error, the same way
 * [GoogleSignInSection] swallows a cancelled sign-in.
